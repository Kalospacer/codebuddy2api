# Advanced reference

Use the [WebUI](webui.md) for everyday management. See [deployment](deployment.md) for startup methods and [client configuration](clients.md) for examples.

## Configuration and CLI

Precedence: **explicit CLI flags > environment > persisted WebUI settings > defaults**. Hot settings apply immediately; restart-marked settings require a manual restart. Change locked options in the startup configuration; the WebUI does not edit `.env`.

Compose explicitly passes some environment variables and CLI flags, so deleting a line from `.env` may not unlock it. Recreate the container after changing these values; to let the WebUI manage them, also remove the corresponding explicit Compose settings.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--host` / `--port` | `127.0.0.1` / `8787` | Local listener |
| `--api-key` | none | Shared management and inference key; management is locked without it |
| `--auth-file` | scan `auth/` | Explicit credential file, repeatable; disables scanning other files |
| `--log` | none | Additional text logs, 50 MiB rotation and 2 backups; SQLite auditing remains enabled |
| `--desensitize` | off | Adapt fixed CLI templates, compact runtime prompts and mask keywords with zero-width characters |
| `--tool-stream` / `CODEBUDDY2API_TOOL_STREAM` | `passthrough` | Streaming requests that carry tools: `passthrough` forwards SSE frames as they arrive; `aggregate` buffers the whole stream, validates tool calls (retrying damaged ones) and returns them at once |
| `--no-compact` | off | With desensitization, retain fuller instructions while adapting templates and pruning metadata; does not disable Responses projection |
| `--skip-check` | off | Skip startup preflight |
| `--credit-price-cny` | `0.014` | Domestic CNY per credit for billing conversion |
| `--credit-price-usd` | `0.03` | International USD per credit for billing conversion |
| `--usd-rate` | `7.15` | CNY per USD for billing conversion |
| `--model-catalog-ttl` | `21600` | Model catalog cache TTL, seconds |
| `--no-model-guard` | off | Disable the out-of-catalog guard; passthrough is limited to one product profile and still respects disabling, bindings and catalog readiness |
| `--auto-trial [true/false]` | `false` | Attempt one-time international WorkBuddy trial-credit claims |
| `--max-images` | `16` | Total images per request; `0` permits no images |
| `--image-policy` | `truncate` | Keep newest images; `error` rejects excess images with 413 |
| `--max-request-bytes` | `33554432` | Positive byte limit for the processed upstream JSON |
| `--log-body-limit` | `65536` | Text-log body preview bytes; `0` logs summaries only, not the SQLite diagnostic budget |

Environment variables include `CODEBUDDY_AUTH_DIR`, `CODEBUDDY_IMPORT_DIR`, `CODEBUDDY2API_KEY`, `CODEBUDDY2API_LOG`, `CODEBUDDY2API_MAX_IMAGES`, `CODEBUDDY2API_IMAGE_POLICY`, `CODEBUDDY2API_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, `CODEBUDDY2API_LOG_BODY_LIMIT` and `CODEBUDDY2API_AUTO_TRIAL`. See [deployment](deployment.md) for startup examples.

Trial-credit claims are off by default and only apply to upstream-eligible `intl-work` accounts. Successful/already-claimed results persist per account in `auth/trial-ledger.json`. Failures wait at least 24 hours without immediate POST replay; eligibility and amounts are determined upstream. Keep this file when upgrading.

## APIs and authentication

| Client endpoint | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions |
| `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages |
| `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | Compatibility stub; currently returns `{"input_tokens":0}` without counting tokens |
| `GET /v1/models` | Available models and multipliers |
| `GET /v1/dashboard/billing/subscription` | Converted credit totals; `codebuddy_balance_usd` is the remaining balance |
| `GET /v1/dashboard/billing/usage` | `total_usage` in cents and daily breakdowns |

`hard_limit_usd` is the converted sum of remaining and used credits, not the remaining balance. Without a date-range filter, balance equals `hard_limit_usd - total_usage / 100`. These are local conversions, not a redistribution billing system.

| Management/shared endpoint | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | Public liveness only: `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET /admin/credentials` | Credential inventory and runtime state |
| `POST /admin/credentials` | Import an `.info` file from the server's controlled directory |
| `DELETE /admin/credentials/{name}` | Delete the credential file by filename; returns 409 while referenced by model bindings |
| `PATCH /admin/credentials/{id}` | Enable/disable by account identity ID, without deleting files |
| `POST /admin/oauth/start` · `GET /admin/oauth/poll` | Start and poll browser login |
| `GET /admin/credits` | Inspect per-credential credit balances and segment expiry |

Pages use `/dashboard/*`, management APIs use `/admin/*`, and clients retain `/v1/*`. `/cn` and `/intl` API prefixes are not registered. Automatic model routing requires no client URL changes.

Management requires an API key. The WebUI exchanges that key for an HttpOnly management Cookie, which only authorizes `/admin/*`, not `/v1/*`. API clients send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-Api-Key`. An empty key preserves legacy unauthenticated inference only, not management. `/health` never exposes account, path or exception details.

### Server-side path imports

The WebUI supports direct uploads; these rules concern path imports through `POST /admin/credentials`:

- Place files in `auth/imports/` or the server directory set by `CODEBUDDY_IMPORT_DIR`.
- Only regular `.info` files directly inside that directory are accepted; symlinks, subdirectories and files over 1 MiB are rejected.
- Send `{"path":"account.info"}` or that file's absolute path. The same filename is updated under the import rules.
- Identity includes product profile, UID and tenant. If another file already owns that identity, import returns 409; the same UID can coexist across products or tenants. Deletion takes a filename, while enable/disable takes an identity ID.

## Models and scheduling

Select client models from the WebUI or `GET /v1/models`. Catalogs are cached by account/tenant, region, product and client version in `auth/model-catalog.json`, with a default 6-hour TTL. New credentials trigger synchronization; failures retain only the same account's trusted cache. Legacy unscoped catalogs cannot authorize other accounts.

Beyond standard model fields, `credits` is the lowest source multiplier: `0.0` identifies a zero-multiplier source and `null` means no parseable multiplier was declared. `credits_by_profile` provides source details, such as `{"intl-work":0.0,"cn-cli":0.03}`. Compatible clients may ignore these fields; multipliers are not guaranteed to stay unchanged.

Credential domain / token issuer determine the product identity. Chat and refresh use fixed origins with separate product headers:

| Profile | Chat / refresh origin |
|---------|-----------------------|
| `cn-cli` | `https://copilot.tencent.com` |
| `cn-work` | `https://www.workbuddy.cn` |
| `intl-cli` | `https://www.codebuddy.ai` |
| `intl-work` | `https://www.workbuddy.ai` |

- By default, accounts are selected only for models supported by their own trusted catalog; catalogs and balances are never borrowed across accounts. Concrete zero-multiplier models take priority, followed by expiring-credit priority, cooldowns and session stickiness.
- Credit balance and multipliers are display- and ordering-only: zero or unknown balances never restrict which catalog-declared models an account can serve.
- `auto` schedules an account's default, not any model. International accounts need `default-model` in their catalog; domestic WorkBuddy must declare `auto`, and domestic CLI needs a known nonempty usable catalog.
- WebUI region, product and credential bindings strictly limit candidates; unavailable bindings never fall back to unselected accounts. Disabled models also reject direct requests. Renaming hides the original ID unless you choose to retain it.
- Sent requests are not replayed against another account because of account availability or HTTP errors; later requests select again. Pending catalog/credential readiness usually returns 503 with `Retry-After`; unsupported or disabled models return 404.

## Request boundaries

- All three generation protocols normalize `developer` to `system`, move an existing system message first or insert a default. This normalization does not mutate the caller's payload. Responses projection and optional desensitization process content separately; the whole pipeline is not a verbatim pass-through.
- Images count across all history and tool results, including duplicates, in message/content array order. The default keeps the newest 16, removing only excess images while retaining text and message structure; emptied image content receives a text placeholder.
- `--image-policy error` returns local `413 / too_many_images`. JSON still over budget after processing returns `413 / request_too_large`, without further text truncation to fit the limit.
- Image count does not guarantee acceptable individual image sizes or model vision support. URL/base64 images can be converted; Responses image `file_id` is unsupported.
- Set `stream` explicitly: Chat defaults to non-streaming, Responses/Messages to streaming. Streaming Responses and Chat/Messages with tools aggregate and validate before emitting SSE; not every path forwards tokens in real time.
- Text logs and SQLite auditing have separate budgets. Logs contain bounded, redacted previews, not complete original requests. Treat logs, credential exports and backups as private data.

## Troubleshooting and retries

| Symptom | Behavior / action |
|---------|-------------------|
| Cannot sign in to WebUI | Configure an API key; sign in and restart unfinished OAuth after changing it |
| Local 401 | Client key differs from the gateway key |
| Upstream 401 / 403 | Credential-level authentication circuit opens; inspect and log in again in the WebUI |
| 429 | Cool down that upstream model on the credential; later requests may rebind, but the current request is not replayed. All candidates cooling down still returns 429 |
| Connection setup failure | Retry only `ConnectError` / `ConnectTimeout` once after backoff |
| Post-send disconnect, read/write timeout or HTTP error | No network replay, avoiding duplicate billing; logs include exception type and elapsed time |
| Malformed tool calls | Aggregate validation permits up to 3 additional generations, potentially consuming credits; exhaustion returns an error |
| Empty or truncated upstream stream | No valid output, a missing end marker or an error is not reported as success |
| Content-filter rejection | With desensitization and `--no-compact`, a complete non-streaming filter-only rejection may receive one shorter-template retry on the same account. No streaming filter retry, circuit opening or account rotation |
| Slow responses | Inspect timing and failed attempts in the WebUI, then choose a faster model supported by the account |
| Same account invalidated elsewhere | Independent desktop/gateway refreshes may invalidate each other; prefer separate browser login or stop using the other client |
